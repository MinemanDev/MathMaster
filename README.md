# MathMaster 0.1 Dev

This app mainly focuses on sharpening simple arithmetic operations speed.

## Getting Started

This app is mainly based on simple HTML5, CSS and JS & we have Django running in the back-end.

### Prerequisites

For this, you need to have python (3.6 or above) installed and Django package installed.

```
pip install Django
python -m django --version
```
If you have installed pip correctly then you would not have troubling running the second command. If you have queries regarding the installation, visit https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/


## Running the App

In this directory run
```
python manage.py runserver #Windows
python3 manage.py runserver #Linux and Mac
```

### Break down into end to end tests

Once you have run the code with respect to your OS, there will be a IP Adress given in the terminal. Open that IP in your  browser.
The URL must look like this- 
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
Now, the sitemap will be visible and you can browse the webpages from there.
For instance, If you want to visit the dashboard homepage-
